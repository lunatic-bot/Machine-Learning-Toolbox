# Machine Learning Toolbox

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Toolbox** repository! This repo contains a collection of tools that help streamline various stages of a machine learning workflow, from model understanding and building to data exploration and visualization. It serves as a practical guide to explore these powerful tools through well-documented examples and Jupyter notebooks.

### Why This Repo?

Machine learning projects often require different tools and libraries to optimize data processing, model training, interpretation, and deployment. In this repository, you'll find examples demonstrating the usage of cutting-edge libraries for various tasks, such as model explainability, data visualization, pipeline building, and feature engineering. These tools can greatly enhance your data science project workflows and improve productivity.

### Tools Covered:

This repo includes hands-on examples for the following tools:

1. **MLFlow**  
   [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

2. **Lime**  
   [LIME](https://c3.ai/glossary/data-science/lime-local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations/) is a tool for explaining machine learning models, providing interpretable explanations for individual predictions in a model-agnostic way.

3. **Modin**  
   [Modin](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a library to speed up pandas operations by changing a single line of code. It can significantly improve performance when working with large datasets.

4. **Lux**  
   [Lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) is an intelligent visual discovery tool that automatically generates visualizations based on the data to help data exploration and insight generation.

5. **TextHero**  
   [TextHero](https://pypi.org/project/texthero/1.0/) is a Python package for efficient text data processing. It provides tools for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing text data, making it easier for NLP developers to work with text datasets.

6. **Shapash**  
   [Shapash](https://shapash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) helps in interpreting and explaining machine learning models, with a special focus on delivering model insights in an understandable way for non-experts.

7. **EvalML**  
   [EvalML](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/) provides automated machine learning pipelines, feature engineering, and model selection tools to facilitate rapid experimentation and prototyping of ML models.

8. **Lazypredict**  
   [Lazypredict](https://pypi.org/project/lazypredict/) allows you to quickly build and evaluate a wide variety of machine learning models with minimal code. It helps you assess which models work best for your data.

9. **Gradio**  
   [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/docs) provides easy-to-use interfaces for building and sharing machine learning models. It simplifies model deployment by creating interactive web-based interfaces.

10. **Numba**  
    [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler that translates Python and NumPy code into fast machine code, enabling high-performance computations.
